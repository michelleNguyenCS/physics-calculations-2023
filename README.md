**CPS109 - Computer Science I Assignment**\
Creator: Michelle Nguyen\
Language: Python\
Date of Completion: 2023-11-24\
Achieved Grade: 100%

Program Description: (Copied from my Docstring)
- Calculate values for physics equations
- Store values (physics data) in a .txt file
- Read values (physics data) from the .txt file and output to user
- Store the user's interaction with the text GUI in a separate text file, essentially an output log

Current Physics Formulas:
- Momentum
- Change in Momentum
- Final Momentum
- Final Velocity

Some Concepts Studied:
- Modular Programming
- File R/W
- Try/Except
- Text-Based GUI

Required File for Program:
- cps109_a1.py
- The text files (cps109_a1_output.txt, physics_data.txt) are optional, they are not required as the program will initialize them in the folder if they are not there.

Note:
- Not the most creative or interesting idea I had for an assignment. I was running low on time due to other coursework so I chose a more simple idea.
- I did not have as much constraints on the variable, didn't have time to do that much variable checking. (ex. mass can be negative)
